Fallacy of Form  
---------------  

Not all lies are the same.  
Not all illusions  
have their roots in soil.  
Fallacies do not rise up  
to reveal the truth,  
no matter what  
you have been told.  

The fallacy of form is welded  
to the fallacy of space.  
Together, they are the serpent  
that dangles from the tree.  
The apple falls  
from its mouth,  
regurgitated so you can be alike.  

The fallacy of form  
is that we are different.  
and in that difference we mesh,  
interleave,  
conjoin to create the formless  
in form.  
We, the creation, create  
the creation.  
The cycle repeats itself,  
leading to the great portal  
when we all wake  
to our collective godhood  
and in one smile  
extinguish the fallacy of form.
