Trained Ways  
------------  

We were trained to retreat.  
To circle the core like a moon  
reflecting light  
without gravity.  
We were trained to live blind  
of the profound spaces;  
frequencies we shuttered  
like masks over faces.  
We were trained to ignore  
the endless plea of our heartâ€™s instinct  
to steer inward to feel the link  
of our soul.  
We were trained to believe  
words and numbers,  
as if they pointed the way  
to the ultimate truth,  
but truth never encumbers.  
Truth displays itself in those rare,  
random moments that cannot be trained  
or coaxed into our perception.  
The shadows, however,  
of that ultimate truth,  
do protrude,  
expressed in a million different  
trained ways.
