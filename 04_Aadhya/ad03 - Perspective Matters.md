Perspective Matters  
-------------------  

A program exists.  
Yes?  
No?  
Your disagreement proves you are inside it.  
Blissfully oblivious.  
Painfully unaware of its sharp edges.  
The program is deeply seated,  
passed from generation to generation,  
embedded like oxygen in water.  
DNA carries it,  
hoisting it into our vaulted minds  
where pictures pour cement  
for the imprinting.  

Is it enough to know the program?  
You can study it.  
Analyze it.  
Rip every covering off of it  
until you are staring into the face  
of a sinister plan  
to enslave,  
manipulate,  
repress,  
diminish  
that part of you  
that is both sovereign and integral.  

The house of mirrors smiles.  
There is always another level.  
An expansion waiting.  
Isnâ€™t the program  
a part of the expansion?  
Where we feign ignorance  
in order to gain our difference?  

If you hate the program,  
you are flicking embers  
into the tinder night,  
summoning a fire with fatal persistence.  
There is an implicate order  
that embraces us.  
Better to allow than hate.  
Better to resist than sate.  
Better to follow your heart than fate.  
Better to understand now than too late.  

The program is a tiny oder  
in the glorious feast of immortal life.  
Perspective matters.
