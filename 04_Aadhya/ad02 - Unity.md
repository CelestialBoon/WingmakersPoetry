Unity  
-----  

Too young to be lost  
you need a world that is true.  
No cape with deliver you,  
no payment will cover the cost  
so long overdue.  

You are more than a name;  
given by your past  
to a soul merely loaned.  
In all the mirrors  
I have crossed  
I have seen only one face unowned.  
Unattributed.  
The mirrorless absorption  
of all things sacred.  
That secret network  
that churns duality to make  
unity aware of itself.
