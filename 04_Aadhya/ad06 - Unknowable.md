Unknowable  
----------  

Claws fully extended  
defined in fire,  
I close my eyes and  
see ocean floors,  
the sky’s abandonment.  
Calm, liquid peace.  
The heart’s intellect awakens here.  
Above,  
the out-bound world drifts  
in a sea of verdicts;  
hoping to find and hold  
the unknowable.  
Forgetfulness is the sanction  
of reorientation.  

They have forgotten  
the reason  
it is called *unknowable*.
