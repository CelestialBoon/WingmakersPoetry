The Voice  
---------  

I wept the name out loud;  
the universe stilled to listen.  
Orbiting planets patrolled the crowd  
that gathered with glistening eyes.  
I sang it true;  
I sang it proud,  
with calm tones I christened it.  
It bore the sacred fire  
impervious to time,  
unbounded by a single hour  
it knew only how to climb.  

That sound traversed the spacious skies,  
a sung bolt surging through portals obscure.  
The cosmos, free of any malady or cure,  
stood up and bowed,  
the summation of all material forms.  
Out of this deep, impenetrable void,  
a voice flung itself  
across the absonite empire  
In search of us all.
