Not Impossible  
--------------  

The curious wing,  
oblivious to its chains,  
flexes muscle with hammering precision,  
and the body rises.  
The tugging of chains,  
finally felt,  
remove hope with clipped derision.  

The winged creatures  
settle for a range,  
but have Icarus visions.  
Over and over it repeats  
until the range is compacted  
under the weight of norms,  
and the curious wing is made  
less curious.  

Maps have borders.  
Their merciful renditions  
take into account  
the length of chain,  
the invested energy,  
the centered home.  

The ganglions of separation  
flared their afferent paths  
and we followed  
like debris  
in the current  
of a swollen river.  
No map or wing is necessary.  
Those are for mystical lore  
where the blackbird priest,  
with his feelered hands,  
shames his flock.  
The range grows smaller.  

We are captives,  
hidden tight in the twilight maze.  
What force protects us  
from what force?  
The manacles chaff.  
The wing beats tiresome.  
The final story waits to be told.  
Will we be there when it is?  

And if home is not on our maps  
or in the range of our wings,  
then where is it?  

The winnowed truth  
blown by a trillion breaths  
stands so tall as to be invisible.  
In wavelengths too small to divide  
like the print of an atomâ€™s touch.  
Our mouths do not move to these  
rhythms and sounds.  
The story is being told right now,  
right here.  

Immaculate.  
Impeccable.  
Imaginary.  
Not, *not* impossible.
