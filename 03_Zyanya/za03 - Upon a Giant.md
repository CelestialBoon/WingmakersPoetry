Upon a Giant  
------------  

The earth cringed when I left.  
I heard its voice in my parting breath,  
a deep-scowled tone  
thundering atop all roofs:  
“Didn’t he used to live upon a giant?”  

Metaphoric roles  
like jointed doll models  
prance as Fate’s seductress.  
Always ahead,  
bartering pity,  
deferring retribution  
for the insolvent touch  
of the black crude spirit in crusted books.  

We forget the visit to god’s winery,  
for the memory of invertible, twisted vines  
and the fugue of a heaving earth.  

I have learned to settle within,  
outside my body,  
unafraid of death’s opaque cloak  
that falls  
like a slowmotion leaf  
in the utter stillness of a dawning forest.  
The rhythm in my veins  
entrained to the glorious Unknown  
by the spirit mentors  
Love and Death.  
Lashed together  
like a pacemaker to a heart,  
parallel spirits can fly  
halved or not;  
keening tribulations unheard  
In the safest safe.  

I cannot promise mine is yours.  
I cannot see for you.  
I cannot live as an adversary.  
I cannot chase a finite vision.  
I cannot promise you indelibility.  
I cannot give you the funeral of innocence.  
I cannot, with pointed fingers, accuse  
the goliath mistake of Destiny’s puppetry.  
We might as well be vapors;  
malleable, faint, ghostly.  
With no points of attachment;  
strings fall.  
Giant hands wince without resistance.  

But there is a way  
into the centermost core.  
The collective psyche favors a savior,  
it always has  
it always will.  
The savior is the collective.  
It always has been  
and will always be.  
In that central serenity of permanence  
the feral souls flock  
amid the skies, chanting  
the primal hymns  
of one being.  
One collective being.  
One.  
Collective.  
Being.  

I have heard this chant.  
It remains aglow of purpose  
to draw us inward  
to that place unfractured,  
unmasked,  
waiting for our memory to unite.  
It is all.  
The pluperfect of history —  
all history —  
is not right or wrong,  
steeped in moral certitude.  
It is chatter in the conversation between  
all and One.  
The Attractor, the One,  
is not the beginning and the end,  
nor the beginning of the end.  
It is the before and after.  
It is not the collective all.  
It is the unified one.  
The difference between is infinite  
like the shadow of a universe.
