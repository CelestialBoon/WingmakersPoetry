One and Equal  
-------------  

The stories you’ve been told  
have made you pray  
to the sky-fixer.  
With the weight of a ghost  
in space  
the genie spins.  
You lower your clasped hands  
to your sides and sigh.  
A downward glance,  
a broken floor,  
a stunted breath  
stuttering in the wireless world.  
The unequal falsehood,  
stood up by derelict stooges,  
is paper-thin,  
but as strong as a belief  
can be.  
Forked tongues welded  
these stories to your mind’s basement,  
the casement for the blind.  
What does equal mean, any way?  
Equality is a concept  
from the other side.  
It has not bred  
on this side of the abacus.  
It is the orphan in the corner,  
the inductive murmur  
neutered to  
stand like a sculpture in empty  

space.  

We can see it,  
touch it,  
know it in our minds,  
imagine its purpose,  
but, like a marble eye  
it stares back at us,  
lifeless.  

One and equal is the chant.  
One and equal.  
One and equal.  
1&=.  
Perhaps it is more a prayer  
than a chant.  
Maybe an affirmation?  
Maybe a hope?  
Certainly not a mantra.  

The sky-fixer, spinning in weightlessness,  
waits for more voices.  
The franchised choir  
whose mercenary ways  
alienate,  
separate,  
explicate,  
ultimately precipitate the reins  
that embrace you  
and hold you as seven and a half-billion  
blueprints,  
wandering the coagulate spirit.  
Garbed as particles of one thing  
ignorant of itself.  

You pledge your fate  
to the invisible giant whose  
bowels of confusion constitute your path.  
You rise up in protests,  
victorious with new laws,  
crawling  
to the flying goalposts of equality.  

The genie sleeps.  
The three wishes expressed  
lilt on the winds of time.  
They are:  
ONE. Give us immortal life.  
TWO. Give us freedom within that immortal life.  
THREE. Give us purpose.  
A fourth wish limped behind,  
whispered in a croaking breath:  
Give us equality.  
The genie scowled,  
its arms green and muscular,  
“There are only three wishes.  
You cannot have more.  
Do you wish to substitute?”  

The particles, lost in their blueprints,  
collectively shook one head  
and crawled their separate ways.
