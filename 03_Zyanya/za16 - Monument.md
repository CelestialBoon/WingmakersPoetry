Monument  
--------  

For if just once in its brief lifespan  
the mud-limbed creature staunch entrusts  
the entirety of its being to a single guiding star,  
without thought to consequence or charge,  
shorn of reservation and uncertainty,  
of indurate heart, of resolute mind,  
of immaculate soul…  
it is ever sung and honored  
within the senior ranks of bravery,  
notwithstanding the overt success of its mission.  

The act of commitment bricks the monument;  
a willed reorientation of self  
to the nurture of the seed’s kernel,  
to the perfume of the flower of life  
from which all life springs.  
And should it be asked of me,  
a sprout of divine derivation,  
if the retrospective yields the lesson,  
I would proud salute in quiet reverie  
the God-spark’s passionate audacity  
that emboldens and animates the mundane.
