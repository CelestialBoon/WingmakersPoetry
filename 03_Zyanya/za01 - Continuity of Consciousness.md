Continuity of Consciousness  
---------------------------  

The language of life is gibberish to me now;  
fey, guttural ciphers scrolling bored and restive,  
sibilant mallets of consciousness struck on a vast timpani.  
The tableau lingers in an afterglow,  
and with a choreographerâ€™s gift,  
prior to the vanishing,  
an actor bows briefly, pure and untainted  
and then walks off stage.  
How can a thousand faces, properly lighted,  
be cold and stumbling?  
No applause?  
The cruel silt  
that amends our presence persists.  
A timestamp assures us  
that as parallel spirits of a shared pigment  
we live in a serial time.  
We can pace-off the distance.  
We can overcome the linear,  
and become strangers that blot a destiny  
from the common ink  
of implacable need.  
The isolate choice,  
a universe digging at its own scabs,  
unrepairable  
and therefore repeatable;  
holds us from the silences of God.  
Spun of faith,  
we are the loom that imagines  
the mirror image.  
Despite all of this, we rise.  
Stillborn spirits  
made of vapors that seek the altitude  
that never ends.  
The backward glance does not satisfy.  
The forward stare blinds.  
The closed eye  
gathers the single photon  
and over the rim,  
multiplies.
