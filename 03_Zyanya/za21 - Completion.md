Completion  
----------  

Completion.  
Such an odd word,  
as if anything alive is complete.  
Everything is in motion,  
shapeshifting its way to new expressions.  
All to assemble  
at the mysterious attractor.  
We are untethering  
and reattaching simultaneously.  
Our experience is to change,  
modify,  
reconstitute,  
always to move on  
to the expression of our *next*.  

Unless you draw the circle of time  
around a life,  
marking changes,  
completion does not exist.  
We are the cast that changes  
the stage,  
the script,  
the storyâ€™s arc,  
down to the final, immutable page.  

Until *we* are complete,  
there is no completion.
