Our Home  
--------  

When all else fails  
remind me of our home.  
Even the word is warming.  
In the back of a deep drawer  
I can reach blindly,  
fingers as eyes.  

When I imagine home  
I have no fingers or eyes.  
Something approximate of light.  
Something unbounded by  
heaven and hell.  
Something free  
from the infectious armies  
that patrol the borders  
between black and white.  

Liberation is the ultimate home.  
There is no border,  
gate,  
fence,  
moat,  
wall,  
door,  
or barrier.  
No antibodies patrol  
with creeping tendrils.  
No antidotes to patch poisen’s  
wicked pluck.  

Home is cast from a matrix;  
a boundless source  
unprogrammed.  
A mystery billowing  
like a forceful form half-seen.  

When all else fails  
let me hear the primal hymns  
that soar through the tall,  
half-naked pines.  
Let me feel that ecstasy  
when light and air  
expose the soul’s heartbeat,  
and its drumming  
cannot be unsummoned.  

When all else fails  
remind me of our home.  
In my final depletion  
only speak those words:  
Our *home*.
