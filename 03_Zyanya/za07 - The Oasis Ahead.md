The Oasis Ahead  
---------------  

These eyes that water in the telling,  
drift on the edge of a stream  
that issues from heaven or hades,  
I’m not sure.  
They both have gates.  
To keep in  
or keep out;  
Does anyone really know?  
It could be both.  
The evidence is delinquent.  
Fiddling with levers that rise and fall  
at the will of vacant eyes;  
humans, once incandescent,  
now obscure light  
from behind the curtain.  
Dreams woefully mangled  
into wavelengths long and aimless;  
boomerang to ego  
like a cat at feeding time,  
nustling ankles.  

The treasure is not out there  
in the restless eyeballs.  
The life you thought was to be lived  
is to be annealed into a lump of clay  
and tossed onto the potter’s wheel  
to be reshaped,  
retooled,  
into wisdom’s golden casing.  
Only your hands  
can draw boundaries in chalk  
and walk across them,  
sated by the checkpoints  
behind you  
and the Oasis ahead.
