No Shelters  
-----------  

I walk a path surrounded by  
thorn bushes,  
darting from the underground;  
angling their way  
to the gleaning shelter.  

Can you see this shelter?  
Invisible horses herd us.  
Stern voices command us.  
Winnowing touches draw us closer.  

Our purpose is lent  
from a landlord cast of clay,  
surfaced in gold,  
burnished to a sheen that blinds.  

Inside the shelter,  
compliance of generation  
upon generation,  
hollowed out,  
thinned to the same  
themes of sin and insufficiency.  

How can a shelter,  
based on sin and insufficiency,  
be a shelter?  
An oasis for slaves?  
A detour into the illusory?  
The pull of a demonic shade?  
A mirage of tarnished hope?  
A dream of salvation  
where souls are properly attired  
in bowing minds.  

I walk a path  
that moves serpentine, dotted  
with eyes that see  
around bends and over mountains.  
That see the karmic freight  
borne of a listless, if not witless, mass.  
Whose map encircles  
an entire galaxy of learning  
where there are no shelters.
