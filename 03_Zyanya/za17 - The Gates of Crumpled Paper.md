The Gates of Crumpled Paper  
---------------------------  

Inward goes the call.  
The writing proceeds, but the words  
fall  
beneath my gaze  
before they reach me.  

A hand that is mine  
holds a pen that is yours  
over a paper that is ours.  
Its white geometry  
stares up at me like a gate,  
refusing me,  
using me to sour fate.  

I know the madness inside you  
lurks, breeding with itself—  
each generation madder.  
Until all of us,  
straining to see what is within,  
the last of kin  
a silent monster  
in my shadows.  
Truly, it is not your fault  
that you are a petal of gold  
on the flower of disease.  

I have crumpled another  
page on the floor,  
hoping to please you.  
Another gate refused to open  
so I closed its existence.  
Your pen is too fine  
for my words anyway.  
And my hand is  
tired of denial.  

I can tolerate the savage smile.  
The lock of hair cut in rage.  
The latch left open at night.  
The blackouts that seize you in their cage.  
For that one small gift that you have given  
is not so small.  

A muse of a lonely highway;  
of searchlights that prowl the night  
in a feast of anti-mimicry.  
You have brought me here  
to see the crumpled gates  
that my bare hands have laid  
before your madness.  

In this aloof chaos we call earth  
we have both listened for the apology.  
Stabbing at our brains’ indecision  
every ounce of us drenched in the  
sanctity of sweat.  

The pitiless tint of crumpled paper  
surrounds me  
like birthmarks of the  
cream carpet face below.  
Lifeless and languid  
they imitate cruelty in their disavowal.  

But like you,  
their denial is part of a calculation—  
the kind that is not kind.  
“Tough love,” you said,  
“is the only witness to true love.”  
You sacrificed your letting go so I could  
walk  
above  
and below.  
Gathering the words that had fallen prey  
to a matchstick’s fleeting light.  

The small gift that you have given  
is not so small.  
It has no dimension.  
It has no presence at all,  
yet it gives permission like the sun  
to see.  
The moon to dream.  
The mountain to hope.  
The ocean to feel.  
The desert to desire.  
The forest to commune.  
The earth to live.  
The human to love  
and to leave too soon.  

I know you know us.  
You have pressed yourself to me  
in the falsetto of love’s voice.  
Not enough I thought,  
but it was enough to create us.  

When you go on, past me,  
remember, any thought you might have  
of me, is not me.  
It can only be us,  
because there was never a time when I walked  
or ran or crawled or laid on this land  
alone of you.  
Never.  
Nie.  
Never.  

My deprived angel, if you go mad  
when my flesh  
is crumpled on the floor  
like a birthmark on Death’s face;  
I will crush the gates for you  
with my bare hands.  
I will talk with the king.  
I will tell him you are forgiven.  
I will show him your small gift  
that is not so small.  

“There is only mercy  
in a world of madness.”  
I remember your words’ stealthy aim.  
It was my heart,  
the one thing that cannot be reduced  
by a cage.  

Like an evening shadow  
I will wait the moment of your return.  
The king and I will walk the land together,  
listening for your arrival.  
When you come,  
I will run from my rations.  
I will lie atop you heart to heart;  
silent measures,  
transparent wings.  
The holy art!  

And the time of crumpled papers,  
of launching words like fireballs  
over moats,  
over stone walls  
into the deaf kingdoms  
that hold sanity dear…  
souls will finally sit with us  
around fires and cheer.  

We are not crazy when we hold our breath  
as one lung.  
When we close our eyes  
to the punishment of purity.  
When stars speak  
to a leaf and  
we intercept the repartee,  
and smile  
as one.
