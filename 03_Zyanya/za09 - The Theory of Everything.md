The Theory of Everything  
------------------------  

If we are to walk a tightrope  
with the tipani of righteousness  
banging out  
its querulous beat,  
we must be calm, steady, poised,  
impervious.  

At our back,  
vultures crown the sky,  
ink blots spiraling ever-closer  
to stain the land.  
One foot out  
the rope cringes with the weight.  
Far below, a rattlesnake darts  
from behind gray rocks.  

The theory of everything  
is woven upon the tightrope  
in code that only an ant  
could see.  
Doubtful it would illuminate  
the ant or any of us.  
Everything?  
Really?  
You mean a theory for every thing  
in every dimension  
that ever existed or exists?  
Do you mean the future, too?  

Is there such a theory  
that can connect all the dots?  
Leave nothing out,  
even nothing?  
I wonder where wonder would be found  
if such a theory materialized.  
Suddenly,  
from out of the gloom of ignorance,  
we looked upon our silver screens  
and saw the irrefutable truth  
of connection  
to everything.  
Would any of us understand?  
The tightrope is too high.  
The net, too thin.  
The code, too small.  
Our minds, too thick.  

When the tightrope cringes  
our hearts fall to fear.  
Looking backwards to the wooden platform  
that small block of safety  
with a leaning ladder of Pisa.  
And yet, there is the pull  
of the other side.  
The jawboning parrots block the way  
critics of all things original,  
The theory of everything  
is the most original  
of all originality  
for the simple reason it threads  
everything  
in a single fabric.  
What could be more original than that?
