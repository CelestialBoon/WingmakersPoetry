Real Gold  
---------  

Following fires that bore into the land  
like storms driven by lightning,  
I see horizons cast deep,  
flung by powerful, emboldened arms.  
There, in that crease that folds mystery,  
I can see a future  
where ten billion differing beliefs  
disintegrate into one.  
Where the inside-out clarifies  
why slavery can finally die.  

We have been wrapped in slavery  
since time was born on earth.  
We accept the husk,  
as if it was us.  
The fools gold of spirituality.  
The dazzle of light.  
The glamor of angelic hosts.  
The vanity of hierarchies undisclosed.  
Its recipients; love-obsessed people  
with u-shaped mouths.  

The sovereign is integral.  
It is not cut-off from the motherload.  
The pocket of gold spreads everywhere.  
There is no mine to find.  
We are it.  
There is no have/have not.  
There is only illusion.  
The program.  
The lie.  

The truth?  
Well, that is worth finding.  
But it is underneath and beyond and invisible.  
It is cloaked and silent.  
It dreams us awake,  
and nightmares us asleep.  
It runs when we walk  
and walks when we crawl.  
It seems to tease  
like a harmless want.  
The truth is,  
itâ€™s clear like perfect glass.  
An oasis or mirage?  
Somewhere in that midpoint,  
intoning threats of sin.  

We stand at the perfect glass,  
watching the tarnished gift of mortality.  
We delete love  
in every judgment and blame.  
Yet love remains  
the only game.
