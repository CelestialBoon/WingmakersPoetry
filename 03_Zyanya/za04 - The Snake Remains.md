The Snake Remains  
-----------------  

Extreme measures were required,  
not platitudes without the how.  
Hunting quarry with insults  
is as ancient as humanity  
sloughing its generational skin,  
but the snake remains.  
You can try to be the sum of all suns,  
like a sparkle conspiring to dazzle its  
diamond host,  
but the snake remains.  

We are pronged  
on the wrong setting  
like stained glass wanderers  
tightly framed in gray, stone blocks.  
The brazen herd watches  
in the humming light and musty air  
of truth’s museum.  
Booming notes from a holy organ  
whirl about their conflicted limbs,  
but the snake remains.  

A fire approaches  
herded by winds that confess  
that they are the only protectant  
from the rope’s end.  
Held by choking hands,  
a slippage into oblivion  
right on the border of Elysium,  
so close to home,  
but the snake remains.  

The mirror’s countenance is unchanged,  
a vague hereafter is dealt in equitous calm.  
You look at your reflection,  
as if prying off the lid of a paint can  
completes the work.  
When all else fails  
you can push forward,  
the onward breathing that draws life  
from the thin air.  
Feel that magic!  
The thin air!  
But the snake remains.  

There is a showdown long coming.  
The knowledge of good and evil  
bears shriveled fruit.  
Duality exhumed  
to resume its quarantined patch of space;  
and the only cannibal of note —  
the ouroboros —  
will dine  
on the flesh of time.  

How do we continue to bloom  
when the snake remains?  
When holes punch through us  
and scatter our sight?  
How do we listen,  
just listen,  
listen,  
when the hissing remains  
and the slithering unsettles?  

In some way, we are all revenants,  
poking through the earthen crust  
like seeds whose code  
impels the search for light.  
A tree falls  
and no one hears  
its crashing reverberations.  
The echo persists  
deep below in that hollow, cavernous  
space we call life.  
We hardly notice,  
but the snake remains.
