My Quietest Voice  
-----------------  

If I could speak  
the quietest voice of my body,  
I would doubtless disturb you.  
I would tell you of noble gestures,  
confounded by glamor and gain,  
that codified discontent.  
I would tell you that the search  
is cast in the wrong direction,  
because the maps were written  
beneath wings of steel.  
I would tell you that the  
one thing missing,  
that hibernates within each of us,  
asleep in the surrender of hope and belief,  
is the proof  
that we are one and equal.  
I would tell you that this proof  
is not so hard to find  
if you are willing to live  
from the heart.  
Only there  
is the proof surfaced  
like a whaleâ€™s breath.  
I would tell you that the mind is a prism  
that separates colors,  
disunites forms,  
and severs realities;  
while the heart fuses,  
mixes, and coheres.  
I would, in my very quietest voice,  
a voice that even an ant would  
strain to hear,  
tell you that the proof  
is in the heart.
