So, So Slowly  
-------------  

You cannot mute fire with Holy Water.  
You cannot lure the wind to obey.  
Yout cannot find the weakest in the stronger.  
You cannot answer the questions that stay.  

Cannot is the limit of can,  
that you cannot unbelieve.  
If you live a full lifeâ€™s span,  
gravity falls without reprieve.  

Life is a humble, sprawling beast,  
a tinder night seeking embers.  
A castoff world unmoored released;  
licking losses it falsely remembers.  

Behaviors beneath the skin bloom,  
their mount of the inner vessel complete.  
Vanity spreads the bristles of its broom,  
sweeping virtues to the street.  

If we give, truly give of ourselves,  
the water within becomes holy.  
We learn what the universe tells,  
even though it seems to speak  
so, so slowly.
