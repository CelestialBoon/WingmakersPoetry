Purpose Penned  
--------------  

If I am free  
then walls do not exist.  
There are no iron bars  
that cross windows.  
No tape to seal lips.  
There are no wars  
that settle scores  
or torch the night  
in high-pitched wails.  

If I am free  
then not a single child  
is hungry for love.  
There are no whispers  
of hate  
or glorification  
of handwritten fates.  

If I am free  
then there is no path.  
Beliefs hurl their decrees,  
dissolved in the aftermath  
of an untold foretelling.  

If I am free  
then so are you,  
even if we are transferred  
to the bottom shelf  
of the universe.  
We remain the selfless self,  
un-imprisoned in the unreal.  
We are stewards and shepherds  
of this recognition.  
Purpose penned.
