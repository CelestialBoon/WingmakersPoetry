Broken  
------  

The frightened populace  
edges closer;  
a herd of ominous calamity,  
yawning at the wing-full sky.  
Switching tails rally against the flies.  
Predators creep in the borderlands.  
Some with bodies,  
some with only a watermark.  
A tightening spiral  
brings tension.  
Tension brings wear.  
Wear brings breakage.  
Breakage brings repair.  

Healing is innate,  
if allowed.  
If a space is made,  
if a time is given,  
if an open mind receives;  
healing can step in.  
The graveled crowds  
gnaw on the bleached bones  
of sanctimony,  
hoping to find a nutrient path  
to accrete wisdom.  

Wisdom is not found in the herd.  
Wisdom is not found in the book.  
Wisdom is not found in the path.  
Wisdom is not found in the other.  

The mindâ€™s scrapbook interior  
hoarded dreams and desires  
like the pantry of a billionaire.  
But where is wisdom on the shelf?  

Wisdom is healing.  
It is what recognizes and repairs  
the broken.
