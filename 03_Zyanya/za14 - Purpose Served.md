Purpose Served  
--------------  

Do not be seduced  
by the plow of nihilism.  
Its seeds sprout,  
and nihilists believe  
in the sun, water and soil.  
They are the equal and opposite effect  
of something ineffable,  
where real, unreal, and surreal  
align in a magnetic clasp  
of surrender.  

The Enlightenment obscured  
the ineffable,  
like an eclipse  
blunts the moon or sun.  
The core of light  
is unchanged;  
the program of blockage  
ebbs and flows  
through generational time.  
Science will prove perennial mysticism.  
The eclipse is always temporary.  
But in the shadows  
the senses come alive.  
Purpose served.
