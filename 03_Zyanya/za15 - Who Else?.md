Who Else?  
---------  

In all of this change,  
can we live blind?  

What other species summons fire?  
Who else walks the earth  
with feet on ground,  
arms raised up  
in argument with the invisible truth?  

Who else?  

Can we live blind  
like cave dwellers who cling to walls,  
waiting for survival to crack  
their translucent skin?  

Who else?  

If we blame the gods or spirits or ghosts  
then we miss the connections.  
We become the nucleus of disconnection.  

Blame pours like crude oil  
thickening, curdling, poisoning,  
filling the cavities so receptive  
to its leaden voice.  

Our collective minds  
frame the savior  
in golden tones of sin and shame.  
Fear strikes out  
and we call the invisible  
on our psychic phone  
to absolve us.  

The blame is plain,  
it falls like rain.  
It enters like water  
fills a glass  
half empty.  

Who else?
