Testimony  
---------  

I’m sitting in a pew;  
a child of eight.  
A deacon winces behind a lecturn  
as he recalls the bitter plight  
from which he was saved.  
For some reason they call it testimony.  
In the deacon’s moment of salvation,  
when he was in the pit of despair  
and the hand of God reached down  
to save him,  
he was naked.  
Not even a figleaf.  
(Damn and dam those Adamic themes.)  

The deacon had been  
the victim of alcohol and nameless drugs,  
caught in their merciless undertow.  
He ended up in the fetal position  
on the floor of his shower (not exactly Eden),  
when something miraculous happened.  
A voice spoke to him.  
I wanted to ask, were the drugs still working?  
But it was church,  
and my father was next to me.  
I didn’t want to invoke the stern lanterns  
or the stooping whisper.  

That voice, at least to the deacon,  
was real.  
it wasn’t his imagination, he protested,  
or having been caught in the crossfire  
of alcohol and heroin.  
No…  
he made that quite clear.  

Instead, by a miracle’s mirage  
the deacon had stood to his feet, half-choking,  
half-baptized by water,  
in a birthday suit  
that I couldn’t help curiously imagining.  
The voice the deacon heard,  
seemed to need a capital “V”,  
because he had referred to it as the Voice.  
It’s a funny thing to me is that god  
should be capitalized, as if it’s a proper noun,  
and any action (verb) or thing (noun)  
that issues from god, should also be capitalized.  
No comprender.  
God is not a name for a person.  
Even when I was eight  
I knew that god was an indefinite pronoun.  

But back to the Voice.  
The deacon’s cadence slowed down,  
his tone wrenchingly somber,  
and then, he whispered the words the Voice told him  
(from outside of himself,  
he emphasized one more time):  
“Lift yourself up. You have work to do.”  

Hmm, I had been properly baited,  
reeled in,  
fileted and baked,  
and then this punchline?  
That was the Voice?  
Of god?  
That’s all it said?  
That was what saved you?  
That’s your testimony?  
That was divine intervention?  
For a deacon?  
What about me?  
Maybe the voice would say:  
“Get out of bed. You have school!”  
My mom said that.  
Regularly.  
That’s my testimony.
