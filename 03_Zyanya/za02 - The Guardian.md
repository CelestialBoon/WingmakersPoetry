The Guardian  
------------  

In a paralyzed moment  
the shift bellowed.  
Time crashed  
to the black tarmac;  
a pile of thrones.  
Tectonic plates lurched  
at me like celebrants  
of a victory march.  
My heart spun  
in the blue, viscous liquid;  
its centrifugal force  
forever separating  
the hopeful from the insufficient.  
And now, yes, just now,  
the minutes pool  
like cut stones of  
an ancient pyramid.  
Time restored,  
my spirit can once again  
spit soft, vanilla words  
upon the desecrate earth.  
Who or what intervened?  
A guardian forsworn  
to protect pilgrims  
from themselves?  
An entrapped guard  
that decided —  
in the winking subversion of fate —  
to ever-so-slowly  
become me?  

A deep-cast search  
reveals the single eye,  
the untethered diadem  
that swells in secrecy.  
Its mystery cloak,  
like counterpoints unwoven,  
drape like wings,  
and I shimmer,  
as it grazes my shoulder.  
A winged guardian  
steps out  
and I feel the  
countdown of self-destruction.  
A compulsory step forward.  
A mutual stare.  
The stubborn arrival  
that cannot be withheld.  
Calling a name  
expelled from a vacuum;  
announcing itself  
like a sudden flare in the  
blackest night.  

The guardian  
within the guardian,  
forever in contempt of court,  
served a hasty warning  
to the bought verdicts and  
embodied deprival.  
The evaporate world,  
slung in the compost  
of a universe uncharted,  
reveals the one name  
that is nontemporal.  
It is the name  
of an eternal psyche  
lost in a thousand-linked  
chain of temporal bodies.  
Each chain, a guardian.  
Each guardian, a wisdom-giver.  
Each wisdom-giver, a god.  
Each god, a universe.  
Each universe,  
a leavening of all  
through the cut stones  
of time.  

The paralyzed moment,  
beneath the lens  
of the diamond core,  
an undying perfection  
unperturbed  
like a spring-fed stream  
enters a flaming forest.
