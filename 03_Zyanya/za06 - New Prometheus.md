New Prometheus  
--------------  

Body sees.  
Emotion feels.  
Mind groks.  
Soul is lit  
from a fire  
we cannot see  
or feel  
or comprehend.  

Faith, a flat earth,  
cast off from the matrix of unity.  
It survived by pulling the sky-curtain back  
and releasing the angels —  
both good and bad.  
Our binary world  
rooted in righteous irrationality.  

The door of no return,  
built by a disfigured mind that ushers  
final breathers to their life retrospect  
against the whiteboard of binary code.  
There is no debugging.  
There is no real release.  
Only the circuitous re-entry  
into the cave of silhouettes.  
The rehearsals staged.  

Perhaps Plato suffered the disillusionment  
that all true mystics — imperiled by detachment —  
see, feel, and grok  
when they stumble upon  
the source of the fire.  
There was never education  
in the binary world.  
It was a program.  
The source of the fire  
and the source of the program  
are not entangled  
in any manner, except one.  
They are one.  
And it is precisely there  
where the disillusionment  
rises up on its very tiptoes, waving its arms  
and shouting: there is only the dance.  
(Thank you, T.S. Elliot.)  

The stillpoint smiles,  
a doppelganger of the Mona Lisa.  
E=MC2;  
but the fire is not energy.  
It is not dance.  
How can such utterly opposite things be one?  
We need a new formula  
that pierces the interdimensional conclaves  
of weirdness (spooky, if you prefer)  
and bears humanity a new Prometheus.
