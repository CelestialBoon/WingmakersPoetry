What If  
-------  

What if you could see  
the universe as your home?  
What if you could talk with God…  
I mean really talk with the universal spirit?  
What if the highest frequency in the universe  
circled you moment to moment.  
What if every morning you woke  
11 million miles away?  
What if you lived forever?  
Yes,  
yes,  
yes,  
yes,  
and yes.  

What if your learnings were lost  
and you started anew?  
Would you re-find them?  
The very same ones?  
Why would you?  
The brilliant presence  
has suffered in the intellect.  
Isn’t it time  
to do the penultimate crime  
and open eyes that lighten?
